# Unified Documentation for Impact Products Initiative - Roadmap and Vision

## Introduction
Leveraging blockchain technology, the Impact Products Initiative is at the forefront of creating meaningful change across environmental and social landscapes. With our first Impact Products launched, we embark on a journey to develop a comprehensive ecosystem where contributions lead to tangible impacts and recognition.

## The First Impact NFT: A Milestone
Our initiative begins with the first Impact Product, embodying our commitment to bridging blockchain with impactful causes. This NFT, associated with an Impact Value (IV), marks the first step in our mission to make a difference.

### Impact Value (IV): Quantifying Change
The Impact Value system measures the positive change each NFT contributes to, serving as a transparent metric that enhances the value and appeal of participating in our initiative.

## Enriching the Initiative: Future Directions

### Expanding the Impact NFT Collection
- **Collaborative Creations**: Engage with NGOs and social enterprises to curate NFTs that represent a spectrum of causes, from reforestation to education access.
- **Diverse Impacts**: Each upcoming NFT will highlight a specific project, ensuring contributors can support causes close to their hearts.

### Launching the Impact NFT Marketplace
- **A Platform for Change**: Our marketplace will not just facilitate transactions but also serve as a community hub where contributors can learn about and engage with various projects.
- **Enhancing Accessibility**: With a focus on user experience, we aim to make contributing to global causes as easy as purchasing an NFT.

### Implementing the Impact Onchain Rank (IOR)
- **Building a Community of Change-Makers**: IOR will recognize the cumulative impact of contributors, fostering a sense of achievement and competition for good.
- **Unlocking New Possibilities**: Contributors with high IOR levels will access unique opportunities, such as participating in decision-making processes for future projects.

### Partnership and Verification
- **Enhancing Trust with Gitcoin Passport**: Our verification partnership ensures that contributions are recognized across the ecosystem, adding an extra layer of trust and credibility.

## Roadmap
